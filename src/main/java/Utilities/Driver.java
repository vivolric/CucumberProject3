        Why we are creating this driver?

            Because we need to use one driver in every step definition and in the page classes.
                To do that first option send the driver by constructor.

                Second way create one driver it is a static.

        Because we are using one driver in the project.
            This is one concept name is Singleton driver.

            INTERVIEW QUESTION:
            What is singleton or what is singleton driver?
                I am using singleton in my current project. My driver is a singleton and whenever I need
                    a driver I am taking from my Driver class.
